#  Innoscripta Banking Service

This project is a **Golang backend service** for managing bank accounts and transactions.  
It supports:
- Account creation
- Deposit & withdraw transactions
- Detailed transaction logs (ledger)
- ACID-like consistency (atomic balance updates)
- Horizontal scalability with RabbitMQ & MongoDB

All built with **Go (Gin framework)**, **PostgreSQL**, **MongoDB**, and **RabbitMQ**.

---

## âœ¨ **Features**

âœ… Create new accounts with an initial balance  
âœ… Deposit / withdraw funds via asynchronous queue  
âœ… Transaction logs stored in MongoDB for fast, scalable queries  
âœ… ACID-like consistency to prevent double spending  
âœ… Layered architecture: `web` â†’ `service` â†’ `producer/consumer` â†’ `repository`  
âœ… Dockerized, ready to run with `docker-compose`

Mock Generate: 
- mockgen -source=src/model/account.go  -destination=src/account/mocks/account_mock.go -package=mocks

- mockgen -source=src/model/transaction.go  -destination=src/transaction/mocks/account_mock.go -package=mocks

Notes
- Unit tests are not yet fully covered for all service, repository, and handler methods due to time constraints.

Potential Enhancements
- Request validation using go-playground/validator
- Improved error handling & logging
- Autoâ€‘generate API documentation for consumers & frontâ€‘end.
- Graceful retry / DLQ for RabbitMQ consumer
